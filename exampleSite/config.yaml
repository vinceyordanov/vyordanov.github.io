      I am 26 years old, born in Sofia, Bulgaria and raised in Ottawa, Canada. Since 2021, I have been living in Malmö, Sweden. I have a passion for 
      big data and creating software, especially when it comes to the stock market and finance. My start-up vyAnalytics focuses on delivering 
      robust and scalable AI-driven trading algorithms as well as NLP models that analyze rapidly changing financial sentiment, in the hopes of 
      helping retail investors make informed decisions about their investments. I also work for IKEA, where I am helping the company become the 
      industry leader in the digitalization of home-furnishing.

          Academic Research
            - My graduate research focused on studying and proving the superiority of intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) Poisson models over
              regular Generalized Linear Mixed Models when fitting spatially correlated data. Specifically, my investigation shows that for 
              geospatial homicide data (output) & socioeconomic indicators in Chicagos neighbourhoods (input), the CAR model outperforms non-spatial 
              GLMMs on almost every metric. A secondary conclusion that can be drawn from the paper is that Machine Learning can have tremendous 
              multifaceted benefits in helping law enforcemenet tackle violent crime. 
              
          Highlights
            -	Successful completion of a one-year competitive MSc. Program 
            -	Entry and departmental scholarships based on academic excellence.   
            -	Completion of independent research project, including successful defense in front of peers and faculty. 
            -	Over 200 hours of hosting lectures and tutorials for statistics courses with over 300 students.
